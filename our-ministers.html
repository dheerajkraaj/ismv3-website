        <p>For the first time in 2007, the issue of 2G scam was raised in the Parliament. Even at great personal risk, he was the only one to push back against heavy lobbying and pressure from telcos including big names on the spectrum auction issue. He was single-handedly responsible for ensuring the 3G auction went through despite a concerted campaign in the media and Parliament. The resulting 3G auction served to highlight the value of the free 2G spectrum being given away and the country today earns lakhs of crores from these auctions that would have otherwise accrued to these telecom companies. Fighting the 2G scam was done at great personal risk and cost as an independent parliamentarian.</p>
